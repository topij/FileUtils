# Future Features and Enhancements

This document outlines potential features and enhancements that could be added to FileUtils to make it even more powerful and user-friendly.

## Prioritization

Suggested priority order for implementation:

1. Enhanced dictionary support (high impact, relatively easy)
2. Additional storage backends (S3, GCS)
3. Performance improvements (caching, chunking)
4. Enhanced file format support
5. CLI tools and user experience improvements
6. Advanced features (versioning, lineage)

## Additional Storage Backends

Currently, FileUtils supports local file system and Azure Blob Storage. The modular design would allow for additional storage backends:

1. **Amazon S3** 
   - Integration with boto3
   - Support for S3-specific features (presigned URLs, versioning)
   - Consistent file operations across S3 buckets

2. **Google Cloud Storage**
   - Integration with Google Cloud Storage client libraries
   - Support for GCS-specific features

3. **FTP/SFTP Support**
   - Remote file operations via FTP/SFTP
   - Password and key-based authentication

4. **MongoDB GridFS**
   - Support for storing and retrieving large files via MongoDB's GridFS

## Enhanced Dictionary Support

While FileUtils currently focuses primarily on pandas DataFrames, enhanced support for dictionaries would expand its versatility:

1. **Native Dictionary Operations**
   - First-class dictionary serialization/deserialization
   - Load and save nested dictionaries directly
   - Support for complex dictionary structures

2. **Dictionary-Specific Formats**
   - BSON support for binary dictionary storage
   - MessagePack format for efficient serialization
   - Protocol Buffers integration for schema-defined dictionaries
   - Support for YAML with complex types

3. **Dictionary Transformation**
   - Dictionary flattening/unflattening utilities
   - Path-based dictionary access (e.g., using dot notation)
   - Dictionary merging with conflict resolution strategies
   - Dictionary diffing and patching

4. **Conversion Utilities**
   - Advanced DataFrame â†” Dictionary conversion options
   - Support for different dictionary structures (records, index, etc.)
   - Preserving metadata during conversions

5. **Dictionary Validation**
   - Schema validation for dictionaries
   - Type checking and enforcement
   - JSON Schema integration

6. **Specialized Use Cases**
   - Configuration management with dictionaries
   - Support for domain-specific dictionary formats
   - Dictionary templating and rendering

## Enhanced File Format Support

   - HDF5 format support for scientific data
   - Feather format for fast DataFrame interchange
   - Arrow IPC format for interprocess communication
   - Avro format support
   - ORC format support

2. **Format Conversion**
   - Direct conversion between formats without loading to DataFrame
   - Format conversion utilities
   - Streaming conversions for large files

3. **Compression Options**
   - Additional compression algorithms (zstd, lz4)
   - Compression level control
   - Automatic compression detection

## Performance Enhancements

1. **Caching Mechanism**
   - File content caching for frequently accessed files
   - Metadata caching
   - Configurable cache invalidation strategies

2. **Async Operations**
   - Async API for I/O operations
   - Parallel file processing for large datasets
   - Background file operations with callbacks

3. **Chunked Processing**
   - Automatic chunking for large files
   - Streaming data processing without loading entire files
   - Memory-efficient operations

## Enhanced Data Handling

1. **Schema Management**
   - Schema definition and validation
   - Schema evolution tracking
   - Automatic schema inference

2. **Data Validation**
   - Validation rules for data
   - Data quality checks
   - Integration with validation libraries like Great Expectations

3. **Delta Changes**
   - Track and apply changes between DataFrame versions
   - Partial updates to files
   - Change detection and logging

## User Experience

1. **Progress Reporting**
   - Progress bars for long-running operations
   - ETA calculations for large file transfers
   - Operation logging with timing information

2. **CLI Tools**
   - Command-line interface for common operations
   - Batch file processing utilities
   - Interactive file browser

3. **Jupyter Extensions**
   - Custom Jupyter widgets for FileUtils
   - Visual file browser in notebooks
   - Direct visualization of stored data

## Advanced Features

1. **Version Control Integration**
   - Integration with DVC or similar data version control
   - Version tracking for datasets
   - Rollback capabilities

2. **Data Lineage**
   - Track data transformations
   - Record data provenance
   - Audit trails for data changes

3. **Multi-file Operations**
   - Dataset management across multiple files
   - Partitioned dataset support
   - Glob pattern support for multi-file operations

4. **Event Hooks**
   - Custom callbacks for file events
   - Event-driven architecture for file changes
   - Webhooks for integration with other systems

## Infrastructure

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Profiles for different use cases
   - Runtime configuration changes

2. **Enhanced Security**

   - Provide smooth migration paths
   - Deprecation notices before breaking changes

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep core dependencies minimal
   - Use optional dependencies for specialized features
   - Explicit version requirements

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for new features
   - Integration tests for storage backends
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Documentation**
   - Clear examples for each new feature
   - Update API references
   - Provide migration guides
